## Task Type: Normal/Epic/Sub: (delete where appropriate)

Branch for development is `feature/#-`

PR to be raised against `feature/#-` (delete if Epic).

> Epic issues need to have a PR created against master, sub-issues can have a PR created against the epic issue they are associated with; this is especially important when more than one Engineer is working on an Epic.

> Branches are created as soon as the issue is worked on (format: `feature/[issue-number]-[issue-description]`) and a PR is created ASAP to increase visibility of the piece of work.
